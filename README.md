# Holberton Survivors Landing Page

## Description

Holberton Survivors Landing Page is a promotional website for our end-of-first-year project at Holberton School: [Holberton Survivors](https://github.com/fchavonet/unity-2d-holberton_survivors), a 2D survival game inspired by Vampire Survivors.

Developed by me and [Yoann Rivet](https://github.com/SpStigma), this page showcases the project, offers download links for both Windows and Mac, presents a special leaderboard for a challenge mode, and collects user feedback.

It's designed to highlight our technical and creative journey while making the game easily accessible to players and reviewers alike.

## Objectives

- Promote the Holberton Survivors game with a clean, interactive landing page.
- Provide direct download links for both Windows and Mac versions.
- Explain the context, goals, and development process of the game.
- Integrate a real-time leaderboard for a special challenge mode.
- Enable players to share feedback through a contact form.
- Serve as a bridge between our technical project and its audience.
